# Readme for customized styles

Most of the components have their respective names for their style sheet too.

Ionic also comes with its own styles and themes out of the box. These can be edited via theme.css or the page.css files. 

One difference in this customized style sheet names is that the "home" component is styled via the "exploreContainer.css" file.
